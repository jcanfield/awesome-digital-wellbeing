# Awesome Digital Well-being [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of tools and apps to help you live offline in a digital world. As a developer, I spend a lot of time with my face in front a screen. Over the last
couple years, I realized that I needed to take a step back. I can be a coder but not have 10 to 12 hours of screen time a day. Once I started getting myself to 6-7 hours
per day, my mental health was better. I just felt generally better about everything. Here are some tools that can help you move that direction.
